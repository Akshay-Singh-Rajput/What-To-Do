**1. What are your interests?** 
* Do you prefer history and culture, food and nightlife, nature and relaxation, shopping, or something else?
* Are you interested in museums, temples, parks, markets, or something specific?

**2. What is your budget?** 
* Are you looking for luxurious experiences, budget-friendly options, or something in between?

**3. How much time do you have?** 
* Are you in Delhi for a full weekend (Saturday and Sunday), or just one day?

**4. Are you traveling alone, with friends, or with family?**

Once you tell me more about your preferences, I can create a personalized itinerary for your Delhi weekend! ðŸ˜Š
